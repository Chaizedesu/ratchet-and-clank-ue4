Course lesson-like organization (Thanks Kitatus!): http://kitatus.co.uk/course/ratchet-and-clank-in-unreal-engine-4/

Unreal Engine Version: 4.9.2, Branch: release (4.9.2-release). Git LFS required.

Foreword
========
This is more of a tutorial series, it is also a way to present to you guys what I have accomplished and how I have made it. Any feedback is appreciated .

I am going to use a function library that I have made myself in C++ for sorting.

The function library source code is located here : https://github.com/Zarkopafilis/Unre.../master/BluHat

The function library video is located here:

Trello to-do and idea list:
https://trello.com/b/vZZ90tKS/ratche...-tutorials-ue4
(This is kindof unorganized and raw but  )

Please note that I am a programmer. Not an artist,neither a UI designer. Nevertheless, I am going to try to make some custom animations , a custom character etc, in order to expand my knowledge and make the project more realistic.

Series Difficulty
================
Intermediate. There is some complexion and polishing involved along the series. Though, stuff like the sorting function library is handed over to you without explaining, you just use it, no insight or explaining how these algorithms work. Also, this just logic stacked up onto eachother, using blueprints. I could make the series to use some hardcore C++ tricks going around but this is more aimed to give you a perspective on how a game is supposed to be built.

Special Thanks
==============
- Kitatus : Insight in animation and the awesome promotion with his new Website (http://kitatus.co.uk/) <-- HOT
- Owl : Helping me improve my thumbnails
- Cedric : Made me use "IsValid" nodes more
- zeOrb : Jumpstarted me into animation by giving me some valid -previously invalid- links
- All the other slack people that were willing to chat with me and propose better best practises! Join us here: HERE


Don't call this impossible, Insomniac games had only 2 programmers an 1 designer for about 4 months while the game was under production .
Enjoy!
